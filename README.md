- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BOWENO,body here can call me bowen.
- I just finished my college career this June.
- I am a rookie in this field,my majority is IOT,but i am not good at the hardware part.
- And obviously I come from CHINA,I am eager to communicate with u guys and cannot wait to learning more not only about the code.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in MUSIC,MOVIE,TOURIST...I love INTERSTELLAR so much!!!
- OMG,I love NOLAN so much because he bring that maseterpiece to this word.I watch the film year by year.
- I am upset because I cannot watch the IMAX version in the cinema.
- And,OMGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG,HANS ZIMMER!!!!!!HOW WONDERFUL THE MUSIC HE AND HIS TEAM CREATE!!!
- When I get into the series of bad emotion like anxiety,his music always calms my mind.
- UNIVERSE,FUTURE,TIME,FAMILY...These factors are the forces that push me forward.
- I also have a favorite anime work named ATTACK ON TITAN!!!
- I feel very regretful because I watched that anime too early!In 2013,I am still a junior high school student.I watched AOT seasonI.
- From that moment on ,I can't appreciate most of the anime on the market.My assessment of them is, not as good as AOT.
- This means that I can only watch a few anime in this decade.ðŸ˜¢
- For myself, AOT is a masterpiece.The story board, narrative style, philosophy and anti-war ideology in this work are breathtaking.
- Moreover,I am also a game player.I played lots of games such as CSGO,PUBG,LOL,Destiny2 and so on.The game I'm currently playing is APEX.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data structures and algorithmsï¼ŒI will share my experience in my personal blog.
- These are only some of my own opinions, which are not completely correct. If you find any mistakes.
- Please contact me in time to point out my mistakes. Thank you very much!
